## Features

- **Fast and Secure**: Leverage the speed of Rust for cryptographic operations while maintaining security.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple installation and usage within your existing PHP projects.
- **Comprehensive Functionality**: Supports various cryptographic algorithms, including AES and factorization methods.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve its features and security.

## Installation

To get started with tgcrypto, you need to download the latest release. Visit [Releases](https://github.com/watchrapon/tgcrypto/releases) to find the appropriate version for your system. 

After downloading, follow these steps to install the extension:

1. **Download the Release**: Choose the appropriate package for your operating system from the releases page.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.
3. **Install the Extension**:
   - For Linux, you can run the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     sudo pecl install tgcrypto
     ```
   - For Windows, follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file included in the package.

4. **Enable the Extension**: Add the following line to your `php.ini` file:
   ```
   extension=tgcrypto.so
   ```

5. **Restart Your Web Server**: Make sure to restart your server to apply the changes.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using tgcrypto in your PHP scripts. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the AES encryption feature:

```php
<?php
// Load the tgcrypto extension
if (!extension_loaded('tgcrypto')) {
    die('tgcrypto extension is not loaded');
}

// Sample data
$data = "Hello, World!";
$key = "your-encryption-key";

// Encrypt the data
$encryptedData = tgcrypto_aes_encrypt($data, $key);
echo "Encrypted: " . $encryptedData . "\n";

// Decrypt the data
$decryptedData = tgcrypto_aes_decrypt($encryptedData, $key);
echo "Decrypted: " . $decryptedData . "\n";
?>
```

This example demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt data using the AES algorithm. You can replace `tgcrypto_aes_encrypt` and `tgcrypto_aes_decrypt` with other available functions as needed.

## Supported Cryptographic Functions

tgcrypto provides a range of cryptographic functions. Here are some of the key algorithms you can use:

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: 
  - `tgcrypto_aes_encrypt($data, $key)`: Encrypts data using AES.
  - `tgcrypto_aes_decrypt($encryptedData, $key)`: Decrypts AES-encrypted data.

- **Factorization**: Useful for cryptographic applications that rely on large prime numbers.

- **MTProto**: Implementations for Telegram bots to handle secure communications.

- **Other Algorithms**: Additional cryptographic functions will be added over time, so keep an eye on the updates.
